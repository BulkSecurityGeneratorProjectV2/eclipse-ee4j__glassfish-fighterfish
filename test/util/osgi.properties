# We intentionally don't import pax.exam.spi, pax.exam.junit4 packages as they are not needed in OSGi context.
# We dynamically import javax packages as they are exported by glassfish bundles which come into effect
# only after glassfish is provisioned. On Equinox, if we don't import dynamically, we will get NCDFE for
# classes like javax.servlet.ServletContext, because Equinox uses greedy resolver and resolves at installation time.
